	<h2>About Us</h2>
	The Department of Otorhinolaryngology (ENT) is one of the most well equipped departments
	 with experienced faculty and infrastructure. Otorhinolaryngology, as it stands now, 
	 is not merely dependent on routine outdoor evaluation and conservative management 
	 as it used to be in the past. The department has adjusted well with the advancement of 
	 medical technology. With the advent of modern day telescopes, 
	 operating microscopes and lasers, the department now handles various ear-nose-throat
	  and neck disorders efficiently and precisely. The department has state-of-the-art microscopes 
	  to perform micro ear surgeries including <i>cochlear</i> implant. 
	  There are <i>nasal</i> and <i>nasopharyngeal endoscopes </i>for diagnostics and 
	  <i>video endoscopy </i>facilities 
	  for all types of <i>endoscopic sinus surgeries </i>including <i>transnasal 
	  pituitary and surgery for CSF Rhinorrhoea</i>.
<i>Microlaryngeal surgeries</i> and <i>voice-improving phonosurgery</i> are also performed. 
There is a dedicated Voice Clinic, conducted weekly, to cater specifically to patients
 with voice issues. This includes the investigation modality of <i>videolaryngostroboscopy</i>.
  Salivary gland disorders are being managed by the new modality of <i>Sialendoscopy</i>. 
  Our department specializes in doing endoscopic removal of salivary stones with <i>sialadenoscope </i>
  and 
  is one of the leading centres in India. Sleep disorders, especially snoring and sleep apnoea, 
  are growing in incidence. Our department has recently taken the lead in setting up a
   multi-disciplinary <i>‘Snoring Clinic’</i>. Our department is the referral centre for airway disorders
    of both adults and children.
